Doing the full "release" task requires a number of gems:

# To run the Rake scripts.
rake

# To generate the website. Note that RedCloth 4.0.3 does not work so well
# with the website at the time of writing, so use 3.0.4 .
webgen
coderay

# To run the specs and produce a report for the website.
rspec
rcov

# To release files to RubyForge.
meta_project
rubyforge



To precompile the Windows gem you need to set up a cross-compilation 
environment. See the following notes for instructions:
